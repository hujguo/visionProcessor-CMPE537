Assignment 2 - Homography and Image Stitching
In this assignment, your task is to implement an image stitching method in order to create a single panoramic image by computing homography and blending multiple corresponding pictures (examples are shown in below). You will use python3 to implement this assignment.

Image Stitching
For the assignment, you will have to follow several steps to stitch images.

1. Selecting corresponding points
In order to stitch two images successfully, first you will need a good selection of corresponding points between your input images. For this purpose, you are allowed to use ginput function (under matplotlib.pyplot) which will operate on images and provide you to select these point pairs (x,y) with mouse clicks. You can use any other function if you know a good repla

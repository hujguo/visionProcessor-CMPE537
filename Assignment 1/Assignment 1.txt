Assignment 1: Color Quantization and Connected Component Analysis
Part 1: Color Quantization:

Color quantization is the process of reducing the number of colors used in an image while trying to maintain the visual appearance of the original image. In general, it is a form of cluster analysis, if each RGB color value is considered as a coordinate triple in the 3D colorspace.  The following example shows an RGB image (~16 Million possible colors) quantized using 2,4,8,16,32 colors.



In your first assignment, you will be working on a Python implementation of basic image processing operations and color quantization techniques. 

You are going to write the function "quantize(img, K)" that takes two inputs and returns a single output. The first input is an RGB formatted image and the second one is the number of colors (K) in an image we aim to quantize. The function is supposed to calculate the quantized version of the image using the following method:

Convert input image to a matrix of pixels. Depending on your image size your matrix should be of size [height*width,3]
Pick K initial colors to begin quantization. Use the following methods to initialize your algorithm

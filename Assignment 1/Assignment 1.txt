Assignment 1: Color Quantization and Connected Component Analysis
Part 1: Color Quantization:

Color quantization is the process of reducing the number of colors used in an image while trying to maintain the visual appearance of the original image. In general, it is a form of cluster analysis, if each RGB color value is considered as a coordinate triple in the 3D colorspace.  The following example shows an RGB image (~16 Million possible colors) quantized using 2,4,8,16,32 colors.



In your first assignment, you will be working on a Python implementation of basic image processing operations and color quantization techniques.
